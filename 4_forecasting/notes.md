# **4. Forecasting & Time-Series Analysis**

> Goal: Accurately predict key performance indicators and identify trends/seasonality in campaign or revenue data.


### ðŸ“˜ Topics:

- Time-series modeling (stationary vs non-stationary)
- Forecasting techniques:
    - ARIMA, SARIMA
    - Facebook Prophet
    - LSTM (deep learning)
- Seasonality & trend decomposition
- Moving averages, exponential smoothing
- Backtesting & forecast evaluation

### ðŸ§° Libraries:

- `statsmodels.tsa` (ARIMA, seasonal decomposition, ETS)
- `prophet` (by Meta; clean API for quick forecasting)
- `pmdarima` (auto ARIMA modeling)
- `tensorflow` / `keras` (LSTM models)
- `sktime` (unified interface for time-series modeling and backtesting)
- `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visual inspection)
