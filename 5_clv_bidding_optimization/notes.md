### 0. The Story

## üß≠ The Story of Smart Growth at GetYourGuide ‚Äì A Data Scientist‚Äôs Strategic Playbook

> You‚Äôve just joined the Paid Search team at GYG. You're sitting in a strategy meeting. The goal: grow bookings, but do it smarter ‚Äî with **less waste**, **more value**, and **repeat customers**. You‚Äôre not just a campaign operator now ‚Äî you‚Äôre becoming the architect of a predictive system.

---

### üåç Part 1: What Problem Are We Really Solving?

Paid Search at GYG is massive. We spend millions on Google Ads to capture people searching for things like ‚ÄúEiffel Tower tickets‚Äù or ‚ÄúLisbon walking tour.‚Äù That spend powers immediate bookings ‚Äî but is that the end of the story?

**No.**

Some of those customers:
- Come back for another trip  
- Spend more than average  
- Never convert again  

So the *real* question is:  
> **Who should we spend money to acquire ‚Äî and how much are they actually worth?**

This isn't just a campaign ops question. It's a **strategy and optimization** problem. You want to:
1. Predict _how much value_ each user is likely to bring over time  
2. Decide _how much you‚Äôre willing to pay_ for them  
3. Spend money _where it will grow the business_ ‚Äî not just hit ROAS this week

---

### üöÄ Part 2: The Strategic Machine We're Building

Let‚Äôs build your system ‚Äî this is your **marketing brain**.

---

#### üîπ Step 1: Predict Customer Value (CLV)

We start with **Customer Lifetime Value**:
- Some people book a single ‚Ç¨20 museum ticket  
- Others book ‚Ç¨800 worth of tours over 3 cities  

You train a model that looks at early signals:
- Device, destination, keyword type, time of day, past booking behavior  
- And says: _this person will likely be worth ‚Ç¨250 in the next 6 months_

Now we‚Äôre not bidding blindly ‚Äî we‚Äôre bidding for **value**

---

#### üîπ Step 2: Predict Whether They‚Äôll Even Convert

You build a **conversion model**. You ask:
> What is the probability this click turns into a booking?

A logistic regression or XGBoost gives you:  
**P(conversion | click context)**

Now you combine both:
```
Predicted Value = P(Conversion) √ó Predicted CLV
```

You just built **value-per-click**.

---

#### üîπ Step 3: Add Intelligence ‚Äì Who‚Äôs Actually Persuadable?

Imagine two people:
- One was going to book with or without your ad  
- The other only booked because you showed up on top  

You don‚Äôt want to waste bids on the first.

So you add **uplift modeling**:
- Predict the **incremental effect** of the ad
- Prioritize only those where your presence actually **makes a difference**

That‚Äôs real **incrementality-aware bidding**.

---

#### üîπ Step 4: Budget Optimization

Now, you have predicted value per user, per campaign.

But you still have **constraints**:
- ‚Ç¨500K monthly budget  
- ROAS target of 2.5  
- Some destinations need more love than others

You turn this into a math problem:
> How do I allocate money across campaigns so I maximize total expected revenue under constraints?

You use:
- **Linear programming** (`cvxpy`) to allocate across campaigns  
- Or portfolio-style optimization to balance **return vs. risk**

This is **Budget Allocation Under Constraints**.

---

#### üîπ Step 5: Forecasting the Future

Now we ask:  
> ‚ÄúWhat will happen if we follow this plan?‚Äù

You use **Prophet** or **ARIMA** to forecast:
- Expected conversions, revenue, ROAS  
- Uncertainty ranges (best/worst case)

You show the plan to leadership:  
> ‚ÄúWe expect ‚Ç¨3.2M revenue next month. With 90% confidence, it‚Äôll be between ‚Ç¨2.9M and ‚Ç¨3.6M.‚Äù

You now speak the language of **business planning**.

---

#### üîπ Step 6: Monitoring, Automation, and Reacting

The market shifts daily.

- ROAS tanks in Italy?  
  ‚Üí **Pause spend or lower bids**  
- CLV changes in branded search?  
  ‚Üí **Trigger retraining**  
- New campaign launched?  
  ‚Üí **Reoptimize allocation**

This is where **automation** kicks in:
- Dashboards alert on key metrics  
- Model retraining pipelines (Airflow, Prefect)  
- Bid rules and budget updates are triggered dynamically

You‚Äôve built a **living system** ‚Äî not a one-time report.

---

## üéØ The Strategic Outcome

You no longer say:
> ‚ÄúHow did our CPCs perform?‚Äù

You now ask:
> ‚ÄúWhere are we getting the highest marginal value?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúAre we spending where we drive real, incremental bookings?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúAre we growing long-term value, not just this week‚Äôs ROAS?‚Äù

You‚Äôve turned Paid Search into a **predictive, causal, and value-maximizing engine**.

---

## ‚úÖ Your Role Now

You‚Äôre not just reporting on campaign performance ‚Äî you‚Äôre designing the **marketing brain** that:
- Predicts who‚Äôs worth acquiring  
- Knows how to bid for them  
- Allocates budget with strategic precision  
- Forecasts growth  
- And adapts in real-time

---
### let‚Äôs sum it all up in a nutshell:

#### Data and Modeling Inputs:

1. CLV Model: Predicts long-term customer value to identify high-value segments.

2. Bid Elasticity Model: Estimates how bid changes affect performance metrics like conversions or clicks.

3. Optimization Layer:

- Combines outputs from the CLV and bid elasticity models.
- Defines an objective (e.g., maximizing conversions while maintaining a target ROAS).
- Solves for the optimal bids that meet the defined goals and constraints.

#### Implementation:
The optimized bids are applied to campaigns, ensuring alignment with strategic goals like growth and high CLV acquisition.

**Tools and Implementation:**

- Likely a mix of custom code and advanced libraries **(like Nevergrad)** for scalable and efficient optimization.
- Continuous feedback loops to refine models and strategies over time.

**In essence, the whole system works together to ensure data-driven, efficient, and growth-focused bidding strategies that align with GetYourGuide‚Äôs business objectives.**
---
### 5.1 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a prediction of the **total value** a customer will bring over their **entire relationship** with the business. It‚Äôs essential for optimizing acquisition, bidding, retention, and segmentation strategies.


#### üìä Types of CLV

| Type                 | Description                                                       | Use Case                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Historical CLV**   | Sum of past purchases by the customer                             | Simple segmentation, static bidding rules    |
| **Predictive CLV**   | Forecast of future spend based on behavior                        | Dynamic targeting, VBB, budget optimization  |


#### üîç Predictive CLV Modeling Approaches

1. **Probabilistic Models (BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma)**
   - **BG/NBD**: Predicts future **transaction frequency**
   - **Gamma-Gamma**: Predicts **monetary value per transaction**
   - Requires: customer ID, transaction dates, amounts
   - Assumes: non-contractual setting (e.g., eCommerce)

2. **Regression / Machine Learning Models**
   - Inputs: demographics, behavior, recency, frequency, channel
   - Outputs: expected revenue in next X months
   - Models: linear regression, gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost), neural nets


#### üì¶ Required Data

| Data Needed                     | Purpose                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Customer ID                     | Identify purchase history per user          |
| Transaction dates               | Used to compute recency, frequency          |
| Transaction amounts             | Used to compute monetary value              |
| Optional: channels, segments    | Used to enrich CLV and segment users        |


#### üß† Why CLV Matters in Marketing

- **Value-Based Bidding (VBB)**: bid higher for high-CLV users
- **Retention Marketing**: prioritize winback efforts
- **Budget Planning**: allocate more to high-CLV acquisition sources
- **Suppression**: avoid over-spending on low-value segments


### ‚úÖ Summary

- Predictive CLV models provide richer insight than static past value
- Can be estimated using **BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma** or **ML regressors**
- Enables smarter bidding, segmentation, and retention strategies

---

### 5.2 Bidding Strategy Optimization

Effective bidding means placing the right value on each click or impression. This requires **modeling expected outcomes**, such as conversions or revenue, and **mapping that value** to a bidding strategy aligned with business goals (e.g., ROAS, CPA, LTV).

---

#### üìà Core Modeling Components

| Component             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conversion Modeling**| Predicts likelihood that a click converts (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost) |
| **ROAS Modeling**     | Predicts revenue or profit from a click/user                                 |
| **Bid Elasticity**    | Estimates how cost and volume change with different bid levels               |
| **tROAS Bidding**     | Automated bid targets that aim to maintain a target ROAS                     |

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Conversion & ROAS Modeling

- Use **classification models** to predict `P(conversion | features)`:
  - Logistic regression (interpretable)
  - XGBoost, LightGBM (non-linear)
- Use **regression models** to predict expected **value per click/user**:
  - Input features: user intent, query type, device, time, audience, page, past behavior
  - Output: revenue, AOV, conversion value, CLV

> These models allow translating each impression or click into a **predicted value**, which forms the basis for **value-based bidding** (VBB).

---

#### üìâ Bid Elasticity Modeling

Bid elasticity captures how your **spend, impressions, conversions, or ROAS** change as bids increase or decrease.

- Build this as a **curve or model**:
  - Input: historical bids, impressions, clicks, spend, conversions
  - Output: marginal return at each bid level

You can then:
- Find **diminishing return points**
- Avoid overbidding beyond profitable thresholds
- Simulate **incremental gain vs. cost**

üìå **Use cases**:
- Prevent wasted budget when increasing bids too fast
- Prioritize campaigns with steeper response

---

#### 5.2.1 Causal Uplift as a Bid Signal
- Use uplift models (CATE) to score users/campaigns by incremental value
- Prioritize spend on **persuadable users**
- Replace naive conversion models with **incremental predictors**

#### 5.2.2 CLV-Adjusted ROAS Targeting
- Predict future value of users (CLV) and incorporate it into bidding
- Use CLV as multiplier on ROAS targets
- Aligns ad systems with long-term growth, not short-term conversion value

    **Benefits:**
    - Acquire more valuable users even if they convert at lower short-term ROAS
    - Avoid overpaying for users with low repeat purchase potential

**‚úÖ Summary**

- Bidding is no longer about static CPCs ‚Äî it's about predicting value and allocating accordingly
- Blend conversion probability, ROAS models, and bid elasticity
- Use causal uplift for incrementality
- Use CLV to correct for short-term revenue bias

### 5.3 Budget Allocation Under Constraints

Marketing budget allocation can be framed as an **optimization problem** where the goal is to **maximize returns** under business constraints like budget, ROAS targets, or campaign caps.

---

#### üéØ Optimization Framing

| Component         | Role                                                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inputs**        | Forecasted ROI, predicted CLV, past performance, max spend     |
| **Constraints**   | Total budget, min tROAS, per-campaign caps                     |
| **Objective**     | Maximize total return (profit, conversions, CLV, etc.)         |
| **Outputs**       | Optimized budget allocation across campaigns or channels       |

This can be solved using **Linear Programming (LP)** or **Quadratic/Convex Optimization**, depending on complexity.

---

#### üßÆ Mathematical Formulation (Simplified)

```
Maximize:     ‚àë (ExpectedReturn_i √ó Allocation_i)

Subject to:
              ‚àë Allocation_i ‚â§ TotalBudget
              ROAS_i ‚â• ROAS_min (for all i)
              Allocation_i ‚â• 0
```

Where:
- `i` = campaign or channel  
- `ExpectedReturn_i` = predicted revenue or profit  
- `ROAS_i` = return per unit of spend (ROI_i / Spend_i)

This structure can be adapted to:
- Add **risk terms** (variance of return)  
- Limit overspending on low-performing campaigns  
- Impose **minimum spends** (e.g. branding requirements)

---

### 5.3.1 CLV-Weighted Spend Allocation

Short-term ROAS can bias budget allocation toward **low-funnel** or **one-off purchasers**. Instead, use **predicted CLV** to guide spend allocation:

| Campaign             | Short-Term ROAS | Predicted CLV | Adjusted Priority |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Branded Paid Search  | 5.0              | ‚Ç¨60            | Medium             |
| Generic Paid Search  | 2.5              | ‚Ç¨500           | High               |
| Display Retargeting  | 4.0              | ‚Ç¨50            | Medium             |
| Prospecting Display  | 1.2              | ‚Ç¨1000          | High               |

üìå Re-rank campaigns not by immediate return, but by **long-term customer value**.

Can be done via:
- Multiplying ROAS √ó CLV multipliers  
- Replacing ROI input in LP objective with CLV-based value

**Benefits:**
- Avoid underfunding top-of-funnel campaigns  
- Reinforce customer equity-based strategy  
- Spend aligns with **future profitability**, not just today‚Äôs

---

### 5.3.2 Multi-Objective Optimization

Real marketing scenarios often involve **conflicting goals**:

| Tradeoff              | Example                                             |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Volume vs. Quality    | High-converting but low-LTV users                   |
| Spend vs. ROAS        | Increase spend but stay above 2.0 ROAS             |
| Scale vs. Risk        | Push budget to scale, but not at high variance     |

üìå These can be handled by:
- **Pareto optimization**: maximize multiple objectives simultaneously  
- **Penalty functions**: e.g., penalize low-quality conversions  
- **Constraint layering**: e.g., ‚Äúmaximize conversions, but ‚â• 3.0 tROAS, ‚â§ ‚Ç¨50 CPA‚Äù

**Tools to use:**
- `cvxpy`: for constrained, multi-objective optimization  
- `scipy.optimize`: for linear/quadratic problems  
- Custom solver loops (e.g. greedy + evaluation) for simpler rule-based allocation

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Budget allocation should be **data-driven**, not static  
- Use **expected return**, **CLV**, and **ROAS constraints** as inputs  
- Optimization ensures money flows to high-value, scalable, and strategic campaigns  
- Use **multi-objective methods** to reflect business complexity

---

### 5.4 Toolkits & Libraries
- `lifetimes` for BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma CLV models
- `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm` for conversion/ROAS modeling
- `scipy.optimize`, `cvxpy` for spend optimization
